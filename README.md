# Family-Ages-Lord-Morani-Viceroy-of-Diplomaticus-
In this challenge, named after Lord Morani, Viceroy of Diplomaticus, we want to find all age combinations that satisfy a group of partial information about a family of 5.

Colin went to see his parents with his wife, Betty, whom, like his father, he married when she was a teenager, and they also took their infant daughter, Charlie. 

Over dinner, Colin’s wife, a noted mathematician, observed that all of their ages contained the digits 1–9 once only and that by using just the + and – signs you could put their ages in an equation to reach the number 100.

“Wow,and to think I am over twice your age”, said Colin!

“And remarkably, if you added the combined ages of all the females it would also equal 100”, added Betty.

What are the 5 ages and how do you reach the total 100 using only the + and – functions between the 5 numbers? (NB:-You cannot split individual ages into separate digits).(Eg. Answer in the following format:-1+/-23+/-45+/-67+/-89)
